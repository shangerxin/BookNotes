# Getting started with jenkins 
- jenkins2 on azure 

To start the Jenkins service, execute:
$ sudo service jenkins start  

To stop the Jenkins service, execute:
$ sudo service jenkins stop  

To restart the Jenkins service, execute:
$ sudo service jenkins restart 

- install jenkins as windows service 

have all the plugins downloaded from https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/

- jenkins plugin 

Download the copyartifact/ plugin (.hpi) file

- The .jenkins is the main directory that contains all the details for Jenkins installation files''

Windows it is available at C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\.jenkins.

- configuration file

logs  It stores all log files

secrets  It is a root directory for the secret + key for credential decryption

users  It stores all user-related details in Jenkins

war It stores all details related to the JENKINS_WAR file

workspace It stores all the files and artifacts related to different build jobs

- Navigate to Manage Jenkins | Manage Nodes and click on New Node

Usage This setting controls how Jenkins schedules builds on specific agent nodes.
Use this node as much as possible: This is the default setting where, most of the time, the Agent node will be utilized for job execution.

Tool locations 

- Jenkins CLI

- Jenkins uses XStream (http://xstream.codehaus.org/) to persist its configuration into a readable XML format. 

- Dashboard| Manage Jenkins|Manage Plugins|Available|Install Disk Usage plugin.

Avoiding sign-up bots with JCaptcha

- LDAP for authentication or indirectly through the CAS SSO server (http://www.jasig.org/cas), which then uses LDAP as its password container. Jenkins also has an email plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LDAP+Email+Plugin) that pulls its routing information out of LDAP.

- OWASP Zed Attack Proxy(ZAP) is an open source web application security scanner

# Building applications in jenkins 
- manipulating environmental variables 

Jenkins has a number of plugins for passing information to builds, including the EnvFile plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Envfile+Plugin)

the EnvInject plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/EnvInject+Plugin).

This is called a parameterized build (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Build)

- JavaServer Pages (JSP) (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/overview-138580.html) is a standard that makes the creation of simple web applications straightforward

- open source IDE for Java developers (http://www.eclipse.org/).

- a modern version of wget (http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) installed.

- recipe, https://bintray.com/jfrog/artifactory/jfrog-artifactory-oss-zip/4.15.0 is used for Artifactory.

-  Tomcat installation directory and open conf\tomcat-users.xml.

# Orchestration 
- upstream and downstream job 

An upstream job is a configured project that triggers a project as part of its execution.

A downstream job is a configured project that is triggered as part of a execution of pipeline.
