- PEP8 
https://pep8.org/
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
https://realpython.com/python-pep8/

- docstring 

>>> def my_function():
 ... """Run some computation"""
 ... return None
 
__doc__ attribute 

- annotations, special attribute is also included, and it is __annotations__. This will give us access to a dictionary that maps the name of the annotations (as keys in the dictionary) with their corresponding values

class Point:
    lat: float
    long: float
 
>>> Point.__annotations__
{'lat': <class 'float'>, 'long': <class 'float'>}

- docstring vs annotations

The documentation serves as valuable input, not only for understanding and getting an idea of what is being passed around, but also as a valuable source for unit tests.

- Mypy, main tool for optional static checking in python 

Mypy (http://mypy-lang.org/) is the main tool for optional static type checking in Python.

- checking code with pylint, checking the structure of the code (basically, this is compliance with PEP-8) in Python, such as pycodestyle (formerly known as PEP-8), Flake8, and many more

$ pip install pylint 

Flake8

- setup automatic checks, working is through makefiles. Makefiles are powerful tools that let us configure commands to be run in the project

    + makefile example
    
typehint:
mypy src/ tests/
 
test:
pytest tests/
 
lint:
pylint src/ tests/
 
checklist: lint typehint test
 
.PHONY: typehint test lint checklist

//run the file 
$ make checklist 

- automatic format tool, Black (https://github.com/ambv/black) automatically format the code. There are many tools that will edit the code automatically



# Pythonic code 
- indexes and slices 

ary[start:end]

- rewrite the __getitem__ for a list 

- create context management __enter__ and __exit__. On the first line of the context manager, the with statement will call the first method, __enter__

rewritten with the contextmanager decorator

- underscores in python

What it does is create the attribute with the following name instead: "_<class-name>__<attribute-name>". In this case, an attribute named '_Connector__timeout', will be created

```
>>> class Connector:
...     def __init__(self, source):
...         self.source = source
...         self.__timeout = 60
...
...      def connect(self):
...         print("connecting with {0}s".format(self.__timeout))
...         # ...
```

do not use double underscores in your code 

- properties 

Don't write custom get_* and set_* methods for all attributes on your objects. Most of the time, leaving them as regular attributes is just enough. If you need to modify the logic for when an attribute is retrieved or modified


```
class User:
    def __init__(self, username):
        self.username = username
        self._email = None

    @property
    def email(self):
        return self._email

    @email.setter
    def email(self, new_email):
        if not is_valid_email(new_email):
            raise ValueError(f"Can't set {new_email} as it's not a 
            valid email")
        self._email = new_email
```

- iterable objects 

If the object contains one of the iterator methods—__next__ or __iter__
If the object is a sequence and has __len__ and __getitem__

from datetime import timedelta

class DateRangeIterable:
    """An iterable that contains its own iterator object."""

    def __init__(self, start_date, end_date):
        self.start_date = start_date
        self.end_date = end_date
        self._present_day = start_date

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self._present_day >= self.end_date:
            raise StopIteration
        today = self._present_day
        self._present_day += timedelta(days=1)
        return today

- container objects 

implement a __contains__ method then we can 

```
element in container 
```

- dynamic attributes for objects, __getattr__ magic methodd 

```
class DynamicAttributes:

    def __init__(self, attribute):
        self.attribute = attribute

    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        if attr.startswith("fallback_"):
            name = attr.replace("fallback_", "")
            return f"[fallback resolved] {name}"
        raise AttributeError(
            f"{self.__class__.__name__} has no attribute {attr}"
        )
```

mplementing a method so dynamic as __getattr__, and use it with caution. When implementing __getattr__, raise AttributeError.


- callable objects 

The magic method __call__ will be called when we try to execute our object

from collections import defaultdict

class CallCount:

    def __init__(self):
        self._counts = defaultdict(int)

    def __call__(self, argument):
        self._counts[argument] += 1
        return self._counts[argument]
        
>>> cc = CallCount()



# Caveats in python 
- multiple default arguments, use None as default sentinel 

```
def wrong_user_display(user_metadata: dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}):
    name = user_metadata.pop("name")
    age = user_metadata.pop("age")

    return f"{name} ({age})"
```

correct implementation 

```
def user_display(user_metadata: dict = None):
    user_metadata = user_metadata or {"name": "John", "age": 30}

    name = user_metadata.pop("name")
    age = user_metadata.pop("age")

    return f"{name} ({age})"
```

- extending built in types, Don't extend directly from dict, use collections.UserDict instead. For lists, use collections.UserList, and for strings, use collections.UserString

The reason for this is that in CPython the methods of the class don't call each other (as they should), so if you override one of them, this will not be reflected by the rest, resulting in unexpected outcomes.
```
class BadList(list):
    def __getitem__(self, index):
        value = super().__getitem__(index)
        if index % 2 == 0:
            prefix = "even"
        else:
            prefix = "odd"
        return f"[{prefix}] {value}"
        
>>> bl = BadList((0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
>>> bl[0]
'[even] 0'
>>> bl[1]
'[odd] 1'
>>> "".join(bl)
Traceback (most recent call last):
```   
   
```
from collections import UserList

class GoodList(UserList):
    def __getitem__(self, index):
        value = super().__getitem__(index)
        if index % 2 == 0:
            prefix = "even"
        else:
            prefix = "odd"
        return f"[{prefix}] {value}"
```


# design by contract 
- Preconditions are all of the guarantees a function or method expects to receive in order to work correctly
- Postcondition, responsible for enforcing the state after the method or function has returned.
- Pythonic contracts 



# Defense programming 
- Defensive programming is a technique that has several aspects
value substitution 
error logging 
exception handling 

- value substitution, replacing missing parameters with default values is acceptable, but substituting erroneous data with legal close values is more dangerous

- handle exceptions at the right level of abstraction

            raise


- avoid empty exception blocks 

try:
    process_data()
except:
    pass 
    

- include the original exception, python 3+, raise <e> from <original_exception> syntax. When using this construction, the original traceback will be embedded into the new exception

def process(data_dictionary, record_id):    try:        return data_dictionary[record_id]    except KeyError as e:        raise InternalDataError("Record not present") from e

- using assertions in python 

try:
    assert condition.holds(), "Condition is not satisfied"
except AssertionError:
    alternative_procedure()
    

- separation of concerns, A ripple effect means the propagation of a change in the software from a starting point. This could be the case of an error or exception triggering a chain of other exceptions

- cohesion means that objects should have a small and well-defined purpose, and they should do as little as possible

- DRY/OAOO, don't repeat yourself, once and only once 

error prone

expsnesive 

unreliable 

    + using generator, decorators to improve code quality 
    
- YAGNI, you aren't gonna need it, don't over engineer it. 

- KIS, keep it simple. not let the user read to check the code/document 

class Namespace:
    """Create an object from keyword arguments."""

    ACCEPTED_VALUES = ("id_", "user", "location")

    def __init__(self, **data):

            k: v for k, v in data.items() if k in self.ACCEPTED_VALUES
        }
        self.__dict__.update(accepted_data)

- EAFP/LBYL, easier to ask forgiveness than permission, while LBYL, look before you leap 

    + LBYL, check the validation before you do the operation, such as read a file 
    
if os.path.exists(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        ...

- composition and inheritance 

have a class that defines certain components with its behavior that are defined by the interface of this class (its public methods and attributes), and then you need to specialize this class in order to create objects that do the same but with something else added, or with some particular parts of its behavior changed.

examples, python exception classes, python http classes 

- multiple inheritance in python, ask the clas for the resolution order

- arguments in functions and methods 

    + The first rule in Python is that all arguments are passed by a value.

    + Don't mutate function arguments. except you explicit let the user known this

- variable number of arguments 

*args 

**kwargs 

- function arguments and coupling 
- The idea here is to reify: create the abstraction that was missing from our design

- structure the code

- liskov's substitution principle, any class, a client should be able to use any of its subtypes indistinguishably, without even noticing

- decorator objects, e can pass the parameters in the __init__ method, and then implement the logic of the decorator on the magic method named __call__.

This will create a new object and initialize it with these parameters, as defined in the init method. After this, the @ operation is invoked, so this object will wrap the function named run_with_custom_reries_limit, meaning that it will be passed to the call magic method.

```
class WithRetry:

    def __init__(self, retries_limit=RETRIES_LIMIT, allowed_exceptions=None):
        self.retries_limit = retries_limit
        self.allowed_exceptions = allowed_exceptions or (ControlledException,)

- good uses for decorators 

transforming parameters 

tracing code, measure and logging 

validate parameters 

implement retry oprations 

simplify classes by moving some (repetive) logic into decorators 

    + tools,  functools.wraps
    
- common errors, wrapper level local variables, remind the closure scope 

- implement the decorator as class object, creating decorators that will always works. reuse our decorator and apply it to a function, a class, a method, or a static method.

from functools import wraps
from types import MethodType


class inject_db_driver:
    """Convert a string to a DBDriver instance and pass this to the 
       wrapped function."""

    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function
        wraps(self.function)(self)

    def __call__(self, dbstring):
        return self.function(DBDriver(dbstring))

# Descriptors 
- descriptor a class that implements the descriptor protocol. 
__get__ 
__set__ 
__delete__ 
__set_name__ 

    + naming convension 
ClientClass 
DescriptorClass 
Client 
Descriptor 

- it has to be defined as class attribute. Always place the descriptor object as a class attribute

```
class DescriptorClass:
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        if instance is None:
            return self
        logger.info("Call: %s.__get__(%r, %r)", 
        self.__class__.__name__,instance, owner)
        return instance


class ClientClass:
    descriptor = DescriptorClass()

>>> client = ClientClass()
>>> client.descriptor
INFO:Call: DescriptorClass.__get__(<ClientClass object at 0x...>, <class 'ClientClass'>)
<ClientClass object at 0x...>
>>> client.descriptor is client
INFO:Call: DescriptorClass.__get__(ClientClass object at 0x...>, <class 'ClientClass'>)
True
```

make the descriptor transparently run all sorts of transformations without clients even noticing. This takes encapsulation to a new level

- non-data descriptors, only implements the __get__ method 

class NonDataDescriptor:
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        if instance is None:
            return self
        return 42


class ClientClass:
    descriptor = NonDataDescriptor()

- data descriptor, implement set method, A possible alternative here is to use weak references, with the weakref module, and create a weak reference key dictionary if we want to do that

class DataDescriptor:

    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        if instance is None:
            return self
        return 42

    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        logger.debug("setting %s.descriptor to %s", instance, value)
        instance.__dict__["descriptor"] = value


class ClientClass:
    descriptor = DataDescriptor()

- we can use descriptor to track attribute changes, logging etc. 

-  functools.partial (https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functools.html#functools.partial) as a way of simulating sub-classes, by applying a partial application of the transformation function for that class

- built-in decorators, @property, @classmethod, @staticmethod 

- slots, class defines the __slots__ attribute, it can contain all the attributes that the class expects

class Coordinate2D:
    __slots__ = ("lat", "long")

    def __init__(self, lat, long):
        self.lat = lat
        self.long = long

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}({self.lat}, {self.long})"


- using typing MethodType to define method like descriptor



# Using generators 
- generator expression 

>>> (x**2 for x in range(10))
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>

- idioms for iteration 

class SequenceOfNumbers:

    def __init__(self, start=0):
        self.current = start

    def __next__(self):
        current = self.current
        self.current += 1
        return current

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

>>> list(zip(SequenceOfNumbers(), "abcdef"))
[(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'd'), (4, 'e'), (5, 'f')]
>>> seq = SequenceOfNumbers(100)
>>> next(seq)
100
>>> next(seq)
101

- simplfy code by iterators, such as nested loops, repeated iterations 

how the auxiliary generator that was created works as an abstraction for the iteration that's required. In this case, we just need to iterate over two dimensions, but if we needed more, a different object could handle this without the client needing to know about it

def _iterate_array2d(array2d):
    for i, row in enumerate(array2d):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            yield (i, j), cell

def search_nested(array, desired_value):
    try:
        coord = next(
            coord
            for (coord, cell) in _iterate_array2d(array)
            if cell == desired_value
        )
    except StopIteration:
        raise ValueError("{desired_value} not found")

    logger.info("v

- coroutines, uses of coroutines, and how to delegate to sub-generators (coroutines) in order to refactor code. close() the generator will receive the GeneratorExit exception

- This method will throw the exception at the line where the generator is currently suspended

- advanced coroutines 

yield from syntax allows us to go further and avoid the nested loop because it's able to produce the values from a sub-generator directly

- async programming, The await and async def syntax were introduced. The former is intended to be used instead of yield from, and it only works with awaitable objects


# Unit testing and refactoring 
- defining the boundaries of what to test 

unittest: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

- code coverage, One of the most widely used libraries for this is coverage (https://pypi.org/project/coverage/).


# Common design pattern 
- creation 
factories 

singleton and shared state (monostate)

```
class GitFetcher:
    _current_tag = None

    def __init__(self, tag):
        self.current_tag = tag

    @property
    def current_tag(self):
        if self._current_tag is None:
            raise AttributeError("tag was never set")
        return self._current_tag

    @current_tag.setter
    def current_tag(self, new_tag):
        self.__class__._current_tag = new_tag

```

    + borg pattern 

```
class BaseFetcher:
    def __init__(self, source):
        self.source = source


class TagFetcher(BaseFetcher):
    _attributes = {}

    def __init__(self, source):
        self.__dict__ = self.__class__._attributes
        super().__init__(source)

    def pull(self):

        super().__init__(source)

    def pull(self):
        logger.info("pulling from branch %s", self.source)
        return f"Branch = {self.source}"
```

    + we can create a mixin to reduce the duplicated code 
    
```
class SharedAllMixin:
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        try:
            self.__class__._attributes
        except AttributeError:
            self.__class__._attributes = {}

        self.__dict__ = self.__class__._attributes
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)


class BaseFetcher:
    def __init__(self, source):
        self.source = source


class TagFetcher(SharedAllMixin, BaseFetcher):
    def pull(self):
        logger.info("pulling from tag %s", self.source)
        return f"Tag = {self.source}"


class BranchFetcher(SharedAllMixin, BaseFetcher):
    def pull(self):
        logger.info("pulling from branch %s", self.source)
        return f"Branch = {self.source}"
```

- builder, structural patterns 

    + adapter, Also known as a wrapper, this pattern solves the problem of adapting interfaces of two or more objects that are not compatible.
    
```
from _adapter_base import UsernameLookup


class UserSource(UsernameLookup):
    def fetch(self, user_id, username):
        user_namespace = self._adapt_arguments(user_id, username)
        return self.search(user_namespace)

    @staticmethod
    def _adapt_arguments(user_id, username):
        return f"{user_id}:{username}"
```   

    + composite, The composite object, however, will act as a client; this also will pass this request along with all the objects it contains

```
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self._name = name
        self._price = price

    @property
    def price(self):
        return self._price


class ProductBundle:
    def __init__(
        self,
        name,
        perc_discount,
        *products: Iterable[Union[Product, "ProductBundle"]]
    ) -> None:
        self._name = name
        self._perc_discount = perc_discount
        self._products = products

    @property
    def price(self):
        total = sum(p.price for p in self._products)
        return total * (1 - self._perc_discount)
```

    + Decorator, This pattern allows us to dynamically extend the functionality of some objects, without needing inheritance.

    + Facade,  a relation of many-to-many among several objects, and we want them to interact. Instead of creating all of these connections, we place an intermediate object in front of many of them that act as a facade.

- behavior patterns 

    + chain of responsibility, we are going to create the events in a slightly different way. Each event still has the logic to determine whether or not it can process a particular log line
    
    + template method, The template method is a pattern that yields important benefits when implemented properly. Mainly, it allows us to reuse code
    
    can work with chain of responsibility method 
    
    + command, The command pattern provides us with the ability to separate an action that needs to be done from the moment that it is requested to its actual execution
    
    + state, The state pattern is a clear example of reification in software design, making the concept of our domain problem an explicit object rather than just a side value
    
    The state pattern is a clear example of reification in software design, making the concept of our domain problem an explicit object rather than just a side value
    
    + null object pattern, guaranteed clients can use the objects that are returned with polymorphism without having to run extra checks on them 

- final thoughts about design patterns 


# Clean architecture 
- from clean code to clean architecture 
- The dependency inversion principle (DIP), explained in Chapter 4, The SOLID Principles, is of great help in this regard
- seperate features into different packages 
- containers 
- They meet the criteria behind the principle of separation of concerns (SoC) of the architecture.
