# Front matter
- AIOps and associated technology and process changes are enabling a complete transformation of digitization.

act, automation 

- big data 

velocity, speed at which data is emanating and changes are occuring between the diverse data sets 

veracity, data reliability 

volumne this referes to the sher volume of data being generated

- maching learning based correlation

anomaly detection 

predictive analysis 

event correlation 

root cause analysis 

- important information that is available in the event console:
Event ID/alert ID

Description

First occurrence

Last occurrence

The number of times the event has occurred

Any associated incidents with the alert

Severity of the event

Whether it is a probable cause or not

Status whether it is open or cleared

History event/alert with associated actions and state changes

- consolidated information, as shown here:
Event trends, patterns; graphical plot of event trend

Top events across the environment

Top applications or infrastructure elements causing events

Information on event flood

Performance data plots for metrics

CMDB views/topology views

Historical data around events, alerts, and performance metrics

- Incident Creation
The Engage phase starts with the Observe phase creating an incident in the ITSM

- Automation Recommendation
The first step for resolution is to recommend which automation will resolve a particular problem. 


- AIOps in totality and realize the maximum benefits by deploying these technologies across the entire value stream.

- At times organizations end up deploying AIOps tools but deploy rule-based logic rather than machine learning, thus reducing them to non-AI-based traditional event correlation systems.

- AIOps supporting SRE and DevOps, site reliability engineering (SRE), where the focus is on managing and operating applications and platforms with a focus on reliability

Eliminating toil means reducing the amount of repetitive work a team must do.

Simplicity
Simplicity means developing the least complex system that still performs as intended. The goals of simplicity and reliability go hand in hand. 



# Machine learning 
- supervised
- unsupervised
- reinforcement 
- deep learning 



# Develop environment 
- python 
- machine learning errors 

Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE) 
(1/n * Sigma_i->n(log(y^_i + 1) + log(y_i + 1))^2)^1/2


# Automated baseling 
- In traditional monitoring tools, a baseline is static and rule-based and is set at predetermined levels.
- Regression 

linear 
polynomial 
support vector 
decision tree 
random forest 
ridge regression 
lasso regression 
logistic regression 

- visualization 

Seaborn: This is another data visualization library that is based on the Matplotlib library

- Automated Baselining in APM and SecOps
Monitoring tools related to SecOps and application monitoring have different characteristics

- Correlation and Association
Correlation is a statistical term that means identifying any relationship or association between two or more entities.
