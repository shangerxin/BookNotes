深度学习经典论文精讲与项目源码实战=唐宇迪;Note=Erxin

# BenchMark 
- basic base line 

website

# BERT model 
- it is pretrained model 
- bidirectional encoder representation from transformers 

remove one word, the computer can fill the missing word from left and right context, all the layer need to consider it. 

- pre-trained model need to add additional output layer to the model to reuse the model 



# Mark-Rcnn
- classic image identification 

high quality segmentation mask for each instance 

facebook AI research 

Mask R-CDNN, extends for faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel. which means we add another branch to do additional things 

- fast R-CNN, consist of two process

	+ RPN, region proposal network, RPN, propses candidate object bouding box 

extract features using RolPool

	+ FPN
	
- mask RCNN two stage 

RPN 

output a binary mask for each RoI, region of interesting, 对其

RoI as L = L_cls + L_box + L_mask 

K*m^2
encodes K binary masks of resolution m * m, a per-pixel sigmod, K classes(类别)

- network architecture 

the convolution backbone architecture 

the network head for bouding-box recognition to each RoI 

the original implementation of Faster R-CNN with ResNets 

Feature Pyramid Network FPN, a top down architecture, pyramid, multiple player abstract features and merged together 

- the front layer can be reused 

- mask-rcnn open source project

	+ use the mask-RCNN 2.1 release 
	download the dataset 
	mask_rcnn_balloon 
	source code 
	
	download mask_rcnn 2.0 mask_rcnn_coco.h5, pretraining parameters 
	
- open source dataset 
- parameter configuraiton 


- Mask RCnn 框架源码

R-CNN中使用最后一层特征图进行特征提取， 忽略了小物体的信息
