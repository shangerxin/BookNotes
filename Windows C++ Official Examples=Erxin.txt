- desktop application types 
	+ Native desktop client applications

A native desktop client application, or Win32 application, is a Windows desktop application written in C or C++ that uses native Windows C APIs or Component Object Model (COM) APIs CRT and Standard Library APIs, and 3rd party libraries

	+ Command line (console) applications
	
	+ UWP applications

Desktop Bridge

In Windows 10 and later, you can package your existing desktop application or COM object as a UWP app

	+ .NET features the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for rich graphics, and you can consume both Win32 and the modern Windows Runtime API.

	+ using C++ for desktop applications when you require:

    precise control over memory usage
    the utmost economy in power consumption
    usage of the GPU for general computing
    access to DirectX
    heavy usage of standard C++ libraries

	+ DirectX games can run on the PC or Xbox.
	
	+ SQL Server database clients
	
	+ Windows device drivers

Drivers are low-level components https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/index

	+ A Windows service is a program that can run in the background with little or no user interaction. These programs are called daemons on UNIX systems.
	
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/services
	
	+ The Component Object Model (COM) is a specification that enables programs written in different languages to interoperate with one another.
	
	Using COM objects from C++ desktop applications is relatively straightforward, but writing your own COM object is more advanced.

	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/atl/atl-com-desktop-components?view=msvc-170
	
	+ An MFC application is a Windows desktop application that uses the Microsoft Foundation Classes to create the user interface. mfc can also use COM components and CRT and Standard Library APIs.
	
	MFC provides a thin C++ object-oriented wrapper over the window message loop and Windows APIs. have many user interface controls or custom user controls.
	
	+ SDKs, libraries, and header files

Visual Studio includes the C Runtime Library (CRT), the C++ Standard Library, and other Microsoft-specific libraries

VS\VC\ folder (for example, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.39.33519\include\). The Windows and CRT header files are found in the Windows SDK installation folder (for example, C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.22621.0\ucrt\)

vc package manager,  third-party open-source libraries for Windows. For more information, see vcpkg. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/

Microsoft libraries include: Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), Active Template Library (ATL), C++ AMP (C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism): A library that enables high-performance general computational work on the GPU https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/parallel/amp/cpp-amp-cpp-accelerated-massive-parallelism?view=msvc-170, Concurrency Runtime: A library that simplifies the work of parallel and asynchronous programming https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/parallel/concrt/concurrency-runtime?view=msvc-170

UWP apps, you need a Windows 10 or later version of the Windows SDK. For more information, and a download link, see Windows SDK. For more information about the Windows SDKs for earlier versions of Windows, see the Windows SDK archive.
