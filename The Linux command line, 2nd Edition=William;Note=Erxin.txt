The Linux command line, 2nd Edition=William;Note=Erxin


# Preface 
- He is also the creator of LinuxCommand.org

- simple command 


$ df
disk free space 

$ date 

$ ls 

absolute /

relative path    ./

Filenames that begin with a period character are hidden. This only means that ls will not list them unless you say ls -a. 

Filenames and commands in Linux, like Unix, are case sensitive.

Though Linux supports long filenames that may contain embedded spaces and punctuation characters, limit the punctuation characters in the names of files you create to period, dash, and underscore. 

Linux has no concept of a “file extension” like some other operating systems.


cd -  Changes the working directory to the previous working directory.
cd ~user_name  Changes the working directory to the home directory of user_name.



# exploring the system 
- ls options 

```
-a 
-A 

-d directory 
-F classify 
-h human readable 
-l long format 
-r reverse 
-s file size 
-t modification time 
```

- determine file type with 

$ file filename

- file content 
less filename

- root subfolders. 

/ root 
/bin contains binaries programs that mast be present for the system to boot and run 
/boot contains the linux kernel /boot/grub/grub.conf or menu.lst is sued to configure the boot loader 
/dev special directory contains device nodes, everything is file
/etc contains all the system wide configuration, scripts that start at boot time, everything in should read aas text, /etc/crontab a file defines automated jobs, etc/fstab a talbe of storage devices and their mount points, /etc/passwd, a list of user accounts 
/home 
/lib contains shared library files 
/lost+found ext3 file system corruption event will contain files 
/mnt older linux systems the contains mount points for removable devices that have been mount manually 
/opt install optional software, mainly used to hold comercial software 
/proc not a real file system, it is a virutal system maintained by linux kernel. it contains peepholes to the kernel.
/root home directory of root 
/sbin the directory contaisn system binaries 
/tmp tempoarary files, the directory to be emptied each time the system is rebooted 
/usr all the programs support files used by regular users 
/usr/bin contains executables 
/usr/lib shared libraries used in /usr/bin 
/usr/local programs that are not included with your distribution 
/usr/sbin more system administration program 
/usr/share all the shared data 
/usr/share/doc installed package documents 
/var data likely to changed to store, various database and spool file 
/var/log log files records of various system, /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog are most used 

- less file name 

PAGE UP or b    Scroll back one page

PAGE DOWN or space   Scroll forward one page

Up arrow             Scroll up one line

Down arrow           Scroll down one line

G                    Move to the end of the text file

1G or g              Move to the beginning of the text file

/characters          Search forward to the next occurrence of characters

n                    Search for the next occurrence of the previous search

h                    Display help screen

q                    Quit less

- special kind of a file called a symbolic link (also known as a soft link or symlink). hard links. 


# Manipulate files and directories 
- cmds 
cp 
mv mkdir 
rm 
ln 
mv

- hard links 

A hard link cannot reference a file outside its own file system. This means a link cannot reference a file that is not on the same disk partition as the link itself.
A hard link may not reference a directory.

A hard link is indistinguishable from the file itself. Unlike a symbolic link, when you list a directory containing a hard link, you will see no special indication of the link. When a hard link is deleted, the link is removed, but the contents of the file itself continue to exist (that is, its space is not deallocated) until all links to the file are deleted.

- Symbolic links were created to overcome the limitations of hard links. They work by creating a special type of file that contains a text pointer to the referenced file or directory.
