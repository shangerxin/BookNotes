Modern CMake for C++ - Second Edition=Rafal;Note=Erxin

# First steps with cmake 
- Popular compilers choices include:

    Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
    The GNU compiler collection
    Clang/LLVM
	
- CMake that I find (granted, subjectively) important:

It stays focused on supporting modern compilers and1 toolchains.
CMake is truly cross-platform – it supports building for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Cygwin.
It generates project files for popular IDEs: Microsoft Visual Studio, Xcode, and Eclipse CDT. Additionally, it is a project model for others, like CLion.
CMake operates on just the right level of abstraction – it allows you to group files in reusable targets and projects.
There are tons of projects that are built with CMake and offer an easy way to plug them into your project.
CMake views testing, packaging, and installing as an inherent part of the build process.
Old, unused features get deprecated to keep CMake lean.
	
	
- the CMakeLists.txt project configuration file is parsed and executed (yes, CMake projects are configured with CMake’s coding language).
 
- Docker (https://www.docker.com/) is a cross-platform tool that provides OS-level virtualization

- install 

	+ linux 
	$ sudo apt-get install cmake
	+ windows download installer 
	
	+ mac 
	$ sudo port install cmake
	$ brew install cmake
	$ sudo port install cmake-devel

- CMake is a family of tools and consists of five executables:

cmake: The main executable that configures, generates, and builds projects
ctest: The test driver program used to run and report test results
cpack: The packaging program used to generate installers and source packages
cmake-gui: The graphical wrapper around cmake
ccmake: The console-based GUI wrapper around cmake

- modes of operation (also sometimes called actions):

    Generating a project buildsystem
    Building a project
    Installing a project
    Running a script
    Running a command-line tool
    Running a workflow preset
    Getting help
- generat e project build system 

cmake [<options>] -S <source tree> -B <build tree>

cmake [<options>] <source tree>

cmake [<options>] <build tree>

-  based on your platform:

    GNU GCC (https://gcc.gnu.org/) for Linux, Windows (via MinGW or Cygwin), macOS, and many others. GCC is one of the most popular and widely used C++ compilers, supporting a wide range of platforms and architectures.
    Clang/LLVM (https://clang.llvm.org/) for Linux, Windows, macOS, and many others. Clang is a compiler frontend for the C, C++, and Objective-C programming languages, utilizing LLVM as its backend.
    Microsoft Visual Studio/MSVC (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) for Windows primarily, with cross-platform support via Visual Studio Code and CMake. MSVC is the C++ compiler provided by Microsoft, typically used within the Visual Studio IDE.
    MinGW-w64 (http://mingw-w64.org/) for Windows. MinGW-w64 is an advancement of the original MinGW project, aimed at providing better support for 64-bit Windows and new APIs.
    Apple Clang (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/cpp/) for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Apple’s version of Clang, optimized for Apple’s hardware and software ecosystem, is integrated with Xcode.
    Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/) for Windows. Cygwin provides a POSIX-compatible environment on Windows, allowing the use of GCC and other GNU tools.

- CLion is a paid, cross-platform IDE available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, developed by JetBrains.

- available for different use cases:

    Desktop development with C++
    Universal Windows Platform development
    Game development with C++
    Mobile development with C++
    Linux development with C++
