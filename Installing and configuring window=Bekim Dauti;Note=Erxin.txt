- Native boot is a method that enables the computer to boot from the virtual hard disk (VHD) without the need for virtualization. 

In Powershell Enter DISM /Apply-Image /ImageFile:C:\Windows10\sources\install.wim /Index:1 /ApplyDir:E:\ to apply the Windows 10 image to the VHD disk

- run Windows Easy Transfer (WET) or User State Migration Tool (USMT) to move stuff from your old computer to a new computer.

	+ from dvd 
	+ from usb 
	+ Boot over network: This does not require bootable installation media. Instead, it requires the Windows Deployment Services (WDS)
	
- install additional windows 10 features 

	+ Make sure that both Hyper-V Management Tools and Hyper-V Platform are checked too, and then click OK.

- understanding devices and drivers 

A device driver is a program that acts as a bridge between computer hardware and an operating system. It helps the operating system to recognize and control a certain device

	+ black exclamation mark on a yellow triangle status indicates that either the device driver is missing, or an installed device driver is not installed properly. 

	+ downward black arrow status indicates a disabled driver. 
	
- devices 

	+ input 
	+ output 
	+ input/output 
	
	+ internal devices, power supply, motherboard, extension cards
	+ external devices, keyboard, monitor 
	+ peripheral devices, printers, scanners, projectors plotters
	+ network devcies 

- resolving drvier issues 
	+ update driver 
	+ roll back driver 
	+ disable device 
	+ uninstall device 


- configuring driver settings including signed and unsigned 

Device Manager, right-click any of the device drivers of the listed devices and select Properties

Technically speaking, a signed driver proves that the manufacturer has tested the driver package at Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) and that Microsoft has certified it

	+ check the certification 
	
Press Windows key + X and select Device Manager.
Expand network adapters.
Right-click the Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller network adapter and select Properties.
Select the Driver tab and then click Driver Details to view the Digital Signer information, as shown in Figure 3.5:

	+ run the File Signature Verification tool in Windows 10, complete the following steps:

Press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.
Enter sigverif.exe and press Enter.
Click Start and wait until the drivers scan completes.
access the log file (SIGVERIF.TXT) after the driver scan completes

- Managing driver packages, A device driver is a set of files that represent the so-called driver package.

	+ driver files, .dll, .sys which provide i/o interface for a device 
	+ installation file, setup information .inf file, catalog file .cat 
	+ other relative files 

- Window driver store is located at C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore. In a business environment, system administrators can pre-load driver packages for the most commonly used devices

the concept of recognizing a device without the need to install device drivers is known as Plug and Play (PnP). PnP has tremendously simplified the work. OS recognize the device by using the device driver from driver store. 

- Downloading and install driver package 

	+ install from GUI 
	+ using the DISM tool to add packages 
	
	Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a command-line tool that enables system administrators to prepare and service Windows images.

	+ Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM) is a graphical tool that system administrators can use to create unattended installation answer file

	+ Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE), which represents the first experience that a user has when using the Windows OS for the first time

	+ windows powershell, get information about all the images 
	
	\> DISM /Get-Imageinfo /ImageFile:D:\Windows10\sources\install.wim

	+ Add driver package to the windows image
	
	\> DISM /Image:D:\DISM_Test /Add-Driver /Driver:D:\sp72517\RTWLANE_Driver\Win10X64\netrtwlane.in

- Configuring credential guard 

Windows Defender Credential Guard, as the name suggests, is a new Windows 10 security feature whose task is to protect credentials from theft

Local Security Authority (LSA). But what is LSA? It has to do with the user authentication by Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) in an organization's network.

In the backend of the domain controller, it is Kerberos that takes care of the user's successful authentication once the requirements are met. As a result, Kerberos grants an authentication ticket to the user's computer, which then uses that ticket to access the network services by establishing sessions

- Configuring DHA, security of your Windows 10 device:

Being up to date with important Windows updates
Having the latest Windows Defender signatures installed
Having the Windows Defender Device Guard
Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled and configured

- Dynamic Lock is another Windows 10 security feature.
