# Starting out

- what python doesn't do as well 
	+ isn't the fastest language
	
	+ python doesn't have the most libraries 
	c, java and perl 
	
	+ doesn't have much mobible support

# Getting started 
- install 
- anaconda 


# Quick python overview 
- operator 
	+ similar to C
	+ with / 1 results in a float (new in Python 3.x), and division of integers with // 2 results in truncation. 
	+ complex number 
	>>> (3+2j) ** (2+ 3j)
	
- list, tuple, strings '', "", ''' ''', dictionary, sets
- file object
- control flow 
if expression:
	pass 
else:
	pass 
	
while expression:
	pass 
	
for x in collection:
	pass 
	
- function definition 
def foo(*args, **kwarsg):
	pass 
	
- exception, Exception class

try:
	pass 
except Exception as e:
	pass 
except Exception1 as e1:
	pass 
else:
	pass 
finally:
	pass 
	
- context handling with 
with open(...) as f:
	for line in f:
		print(f)

//equal to 
filename = "myfile.txt"
try:
    f = open(filename, "r")
    for line in f:
        print(f)
except Exception as e:
    raise e
finally:
    f.close()

- module creation 

- oop 
class Name(parent):
	pass 
	
	
# The absolute basics 
- written as an integer—0, –11, +33, 123456—and has unlimited range
- build in function 
- advanced numeric functions 
- None value 
- get input from user 
>>> age = int(input("Age?"))


# List, tuples and sets
