Docker on Windows, second edition=Elton;Note=Erxin


# Understanding docker and windows container 
- Microsoft and Docker, Inc. have partnered to provide Docker Enterprise at no cost with Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 201

- On Windows 10 you can run multiple containers, but not for production deployments. On Windows Server, you can also run containers in Hyper-V mode to increase isolation.

- UIs like Portainer (which is open source), and Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) 

- You describe all these steps in a simple script called a Dockerfile, and you can use PowerShell or batch files for each step you need to perform.

- Image registration 

    + most popular registry is Docker Hub, which is the public registry hosted by Docker

    + Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) is where Microsoft host their own Docker images for Windows Server Core and Nano Server
- Docker containers 

- This cluster is called a Swarm, and you don't need to install anything extra to run in swarm mode.

- open source projects and conform to the Open Container Initiative (OCI), so there's no concern about vendor lock-in

- Docker engine 

windows server 2019 core use scconfig 

```
Install-Module -Name DockerMsftProvider -Repository PSGallery -Force
Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
Restart-Computer -Force
docker container run dockeronwindows/ch01-whale:2e 
Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Update 
```

- docker in an azure vm 

Microsoft makes it easy to run Docker in Azure. They provide a VM image with Docker installed and configured and with the base Windows images
