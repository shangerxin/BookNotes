- Jenkins Pipeline is typically written into a text file (called a Jenkinsfile) which in turn is checked into a project’s source control repository.

https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying....'
            }
        }
    }
}

- pipeline made of multiple steps 
    + "step" like a single command which performs a single action. When a step succeeds it moves onto the next step. 

    + all the steps in the Pipeline have successfully completed, the Pipeline is considered to have successfully executed

        * linux use sh to execute shell 
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Hello World"'
                sh '''
                    echo "Multiline shell steps works too"
                    ls -lah
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}

        * window use bat to execute shell 
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                bat 'set'
            }
        }
    }
}

    + timeout and retries and more 
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                retry(3) {
                    sh './flakey-deploy.sh'
                }

                timeout(time: 3, unit: 'MINUTES') {
                    sh './health-check.sh'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

The "Deploy" stage retries the flakey-deploy.sh script 3 times, and then waits for up to 3 minutes for the health-check.sh script to execute. If the health check script does not complete in 3 minutes, the Pipeline will be marked as having failed in the "Deploy" stage.

- finishing up pipeline with post section 
Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Fail!"; exit 1'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            echo 'This will always run'
        }
        success {
            echo 'This will run only if successful'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'This will run only if failed'
        }
        unstable {
            echo 'This will run only if the run was marked as unstable'
        }
        changed {
            echo 'This will run only if the state of the Pipeline has changed'
            echo 'For example, if the Pipeline was previously failing but is now successful'
        }
    }
}

- define execution environment, This approach allows you to use practically any tool which can be packaged in a Docker container.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'node:7-alpine' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'node --version'
            }
        }
    }
}

Pipeline executes, Jenkins will automatically start the specified container and execute the defined steps within it:

- environment variables 
Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
pipeline {
    agent {
        label '!windows'
    }

    environment {
        DISABLE_AUTH = 'true'
        DB_ENGINE    = 'sqlite'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Database engine is ${DB_ENGINE}"
                echo "DISABLE_AUTH is ${DISABLE_AUTH}"
                sh 'printenv'
            }
        }
    }
}

- cleaning up and notifications 
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('No-op') {
            steps {
                sh 'ls'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            echo 'One way or another, I have finished'
            deleteDir() /* clean up our workspace */
        }
        success {
            echo 'I succeeeded!'
        }
        unstable {
            echo 'I am unstable :/'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'I failed :('
        }
        changed {
            echo 'Things were different before...'
        }
    }
}

post {
    failure {
        mail to: 'team@example.com',
             subject: "Failed Pipeline: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}",
             body: "Something is wrong with ${env.BUILD_URL}"
    }
}

also support hipchat and slack message 

- deployment 
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        skipStagesAfterUnstable()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying'
            }
        }
    }
}

stage('Deploy - Staging') {
    steps {
        sh './deploy staging'
        sh './run-smoke-tests'
    }
}
stage('Deploy - Production') {
    steps {
        sh './deploy production'
    }
}

    + ask for human input with input step 
Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        /* "Build" and "Test" stages omitted */

        stage('Deploy - Staging') {
            steps {
                sh './deploy staging'
                sh './run-smoke-tests'
            }
        }

        stage('Sanity check') {
            steps {
                input "Does the staging environment look ok?"
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy - Production') {
            steps {
                sh './deploy production'
            }
        }
    }
}

- add test stage for jenkinsfile
        stage('Deliver for development') {
            when {
                branch 'development'
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver-for-development.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy for production') {
            when {
                branch 'production'
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deploy-for-production.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }


# Install jenkins in docker 
- docker image 

use is the jenkinsci/blueocean image (from the Docker Hub repository)

A new jenkinsci/blueocean image is published each time a new release of Blue Ocean is published

Jenkins Docker images you can use (accessible through jenkins/jenkins on Docker Hub)
- install docker 
+ create a bridge network in docker using docker network 
$ docker network create jenkins

- Create the following volumes to share the Docker client TLS certificates needed to connect to the Docker daemon and persist the Jenkins data 

$ docker volume create jenkins-docker-certs
$ docker volume create jenkins-data

- download and run the docker:dind docker image using the following docker container run command 

$ docker container run \
  --name jenkins-docker \ 
  --rm \ 
  --detach \ 
  --privileged \ 
  --network jenkins \ 
  --network-alias docker \ 
  --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs \ 
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client \ 
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ 
  --publish 2376:2376 \ 
  docker:dind 
 
--env Maps the /certs/client directory inside the container to a Docker volume named jenkins-docker-certs as created above.

Maps the /var/jenkins_home directory inside the container to the Docker volume named jenkins-data as created above.

    
- Download the jenkinsci/blueocean image and run it as a container in Docker
docker container run \
  --name jenkins-blueocean \ 
  --rm \ 
  --detach \ 
  --network jenkins \ 
  --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2376 \ 
  --env DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/certs/client \
  --env DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1 \
  --publish 8080:8080 \ 
  --publish 50000:50000 \ 
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ 
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client:ro \ 
  jenkinsci/blueocean 
  
- on window 
$ docker network create jenkins
$ docker volume create jenkins-docker-certs
$ docker volume create jenkins-data
  
download docker:dind docker image using docker container run command 

$ docker container run --name jenkins-docker --rm --detach ^

# Pipeline
Jenkins pipeline is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into jenkins

- A continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers. 

The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file (called a Jenkinsfile) which in turn can be committed to a project’s source control repository. pipeline as code, a part of the application to be version and reviewed like any other code 

- create a jenkinsfile and committing it to source control provides a number of immediate benefits 

automatically creates a pipeline build process for all branches and pull requests 
code review/itegration on the pipeline 
audit trail fro the pipeline 
single source of truth for the pipeline which can be viewed and edited by mutliple members of the project 

- jenkinsfile pipeline can be written in two syntax 
    + declarative 
    provides richer syntactical features over Scripted Pipeline syntax
    
    + scripted 
    
- why pipeline 
code 
durable 
pausable 
versatile 
extensible 

- concepts 
pipeline, a user-defined model of a CD, defines your entire build process, typically includes stages for building an application, testing it and then delivering it 

node is a machine to executing a pipeline 

stage, a block defines a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the entire pipeline 

step, a single task fundamentally, a step tells jenkins what to do at a particular point in time. It can execute a shell use the sh step, bat for windows 

    + declarative pipeline fundamentals 
    
pipeline {
    agent any 
    stages {
        stage('Build') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
    }
}

    + scripted pipeline fundamentals 
    
    Schedules the steps contained within the block to run by adding an item to the Jenkins queue. As soon as an executor is free on a node, the steps will run
    
    Creates a workspace (a directory specific to that particular Pipeline) where work can be done on files checked out from source control
    
node {  
    stage('Build') { 
        // 
    }
    stage('Test') { 
        // 
    }
    stage('Deploy') { 
        // 
    }
}

blocks in a Scripted Pipeline provides clearer visualization of each `stage’s subset of tasks/steps in the Jenkins UI.

- pipeline example 
pipeline { 
    agent any 
    options {
        skipStagesAfterUnstable()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') { 
            steps { 
                sh 'make' 
            }
        }
        stage('Test'){
            steps {
                sh 'make check'
                junit 'reports/**/*.xml' 
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'make publish'
            }
        }
    }
}

agent is Declarative Pipeline-specific syntax that instructs Jenkins to allocate an executor (on a node) and workspace for the entire Pipeline.

## Getting started with pipeline 
- define a pipeline 
    + through blue ocean, after setting up a pipeline in blue ocean, it will helps you create pipeline's jenkinsfile into source control 
    
    + through the classic UI 
    Jenkins > New Item > Pipeline > enter your pipeline code into the script text area 
    
    + In SCM, Choose pipeline script from SCM option, Jenkins can then check out your Jenkinsfile from source control as part of your Pipeline project’s build process and then proceed to execute your Pipeline.
    
    create pipeline from classic UI till the step 5. Definition field, choose the Pipeline script from SCM option
    
    In the script path field, specify the location of your Jenkinsfile. The default value of this field assumes that your jenkinsfile is named Jenkinsfile and located at the root of the repository 

    if your IDE is not correctly syntax highlighting your Jenkinsfile, try inserting the line #!/usr/bin/env groovy at the top of the Jenkinsfile
    
- The built-in documentation can be found globally at ${YOUR_JENKINS_URL}/pipeline-syntax
- Select the desired step in the Sample Step dropdown menu
    + ${YOUR_JENKINS_URL}/pipeline-syntax.
    + desired step in the Sample Step dropdown menu
    + Generate Pipeline Script to create a snippet of Pipeline 
    
- Global variable reference 
env, environment variables,  reference at ${YOUR_JENKINS_URL}/pipeline-syntax/globals
params, all aprameters read-only Map, for example: params.MY_PARAM_NAME
currentBuild,  such as currentBuild.result, currentBuild.displayName

- declarative directive generator
    + directly to ${YOUR_JENKINS_URL}/directive-generator.
    + Click Generate Directive to create the directive’s configuration to copy into your Pipeline

# Blue Ocean 
Blue Ocean is a new project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins. Designed from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline and compatible with Freestyle jobs

- sophisticated visualization of CD pipelines 
- pipeline editor 
- personalization UI 
- pinpoint precision 
- native integration for branch and pull requests 

- Jenkins is installed on most platforms, the Blue Ocean plugin and all its other dependent plugins (which form the Blue Ocean "suite of plugins") are not installed by default. blueocean is part of docker jenkins image https://hub.docker.com/

- Alternatively, you can access Blue Ocean directly by appending /blue to the end of your Jenkins server’s URL - e.g. https://jenkins-server-url/blue


# Using Credentials 
- credentials stored in jenkins 
Secret text - a token such as an API token (e.g. a GitHub personal access token),

Username and password - which could be handled as separate components or as a colon separated string in the format username:password (read more about this in Handling credentials),

Secret file - which is essentially secret content in a file,

SSH Username with private key - an SSH public/private key pair,

Certificate - a PKCS#12 certificate file and optional password, or

Docker Host Certificate Authentication credentials.

- adding new global credentials 

System, click the Global credentials (unrestricted) link to access this default domain.
