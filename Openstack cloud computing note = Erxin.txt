:OpenStack
>Rackspace and NASA are the key initial contributors to the stack.
>Rackspace contributed their "Cloud Files" platform (code) to power the Object Storage part of the OpenStack, while NASA contributed their "Nebula" platform (code) to power the Compute part.
>150 members including Canonical, Dell, Citrix etc.
>five main service families
There are 5 main service families under OpenStack
    - Nova - Compute Service
    - Swift - Storage Service
    - Glance - Imaging Service
    - Keystone - Identity Service
    - Horizon - UI Service
