Hands on computer vision with tensorflow 2=Benjamin;Note=Erxin


# Technical requirements 
- libraries 
numpy 
matplotlib 
anaconda 

- pose estimation 

the estimation of the objects' positions and orientations relative to the camera in the 3D space. This is especially useful for robots so that they can interact with their environment

- instance tracking 

- action recognition 
human-machine interactions (such as for gesture-controlled devices)

- content aware image edition 

- hand crafting local features 

revolutionized the domain is called Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). As its name suggests, this method, introduced by David Lowe 

the SIFT method was applied to a picture using OpenCV (https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/da/df5/tutorial_py_sift_intro.html). For each localized key point, the radius of the circle represents the size of the patch considered for the feature computation

- machine learning on top 
more statistical ways to discriminate images based on their features started to appear. Support vector machines (SVMs), which were standardized by Vladimir Vapnik and Corinna Cortes

- CUDA, a programming language that allows developers to directly program for compatible GPUs. OpenCL

- Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or simply neural networks (NNs), are powerful machine learning tools

- One iteration over the whole training set (steps 1 to 4) is called an epoch.

- If n = 1 and the training sample is randomly selected among the remaining images, this process is called stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is easy to implement and visualize


# Tensorflow 2.0
- Keras was designed as an interface to enable fast experimentation with neural networks. As such, it relied on TensorFlow or Theano (another deep learning framework
- building the model 

    + fully connected (also called dense) layers. Before we explore the architecture, let's have a look at the code.
    
```
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Flatten())
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
```

    + Flatten: This will take the 2D matrix representing the image pixels and turn it into a 1D array. 

    + Dense of size 128: This will turn the 784 pixel values into 128 activations using a weight matrix of size 128 × 784 and a bias matrix of size 128
    
    + Dense of size 10: This will turn the 128 activations into our final prediction. Notice that because we want probabilities to sum to 1
    
- training the model 

```
model.compile(optimizer='sgd',
 loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
 metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=1, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

optimizer: This is the component that will perform the gradient descent.

loss: This is the metric we will optimize. In our case, we choose cross-entropy

metrics: These are additional metric functions evaluated during training to provide further visibility of the model's performance

Passing 'sgd' to Keras is equivalent to passing tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(). The former option is easier to read

epochs, iterate over the whole train dataset five times.

verbose to 1. This will allow us to get a progress bar with the metrics we chose earlier, the loss, and the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).

- The main change in TensorFlow 2 is eager execution. Historically, TensorFlow 1 always used lazy execution by default.

- creating graphs in tensorflow 2 

TensorFlow AutoGraph, The TensorFlow AutoGraph module makes it easy to turn eager code into a graph

@tf.function
def compute(a, b, c):
    d = a * b + c
    e = a * b * c
    return d, e

TensorFlow AutoGraph can convert most Python statements, such as for loops, while loops, if statements, and iterations. Thanks to graph optimizations

- backpropagating errors using the gradient tape 

 minimize a simple loss, abs(A × X - B).

```
A, B = tf.constant(3.0), tf.constant(6.0)
X = tf.Variable(20.0) # In practice, we would start with a random value
loss = tf.math.abs(A * X - B)
```

in the context of tf.GradientTape, TensorFlow will automatically record all operations and allow us to replay them backward afterward

```
def train_step():
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        loss = tf.math.abs(A * X - B)
    dX = tape.gradient(loss, X)
    
    print('X = {:.2f}, dX = {:2f}'.format(X.numpy(), dX))
    X.assign(X - dX)

for i in range(7):
    train_step()
```

we can see X converging toward the value that solves the equation:

X = 20.00, dX = 3.000000
X = 17.00, dX = 3.000000
X = 14.00, dX = 3.000000
X = 11.00, dX = 3.000000
X = 8.00, dX = 3.000000
X = 5.00, dX = 3.000000
X = 2.00, dX = 0.000000

Keras models encapsulate training inside the .fit() function—there's no need to update the variables manually. 

- keras models and layers 

.inputs and .outputs: Provide access to the inputs and outputs of the model.

.layers: Lists the model's layers as well as their shape.

.summary(): Prints the architecture of the model.

.save(): Saves the model, its architecture, and the current state of training.

.save_weights(): Only saves the weights of the model.

- sequential and functional APIs 

model_input = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
output = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(model_input)
output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(output)
output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(output)
model = tf.keras.Model(model_input, output)

- Keras callbacks are utility functions that you can pass to a Keras model's .fit() 

CSVLogger: Logs training information in a CSV file.

EarlyStopping: Stops training if the loss or a metric stops improving. It can be useful in avoiding overfitting.

LearningRateScheduler: Changes the learning rate on each epoch according to a schedule.

ReduceLROnPlateau: Automatically reduces the learning rate when the loss or a metric stops improving.

- tf.function works 

@tf.function
def identity(x):
  print('Creating graph !')
  return x

- variables 

model.variables. It will return the list of all variables 

a = tf.Variable(3, name='my_var')
print(a) # Prints <tf.Variable 'my_var:0' shape=() dtype=int32, numpy=3>

- distribution strategies 

The tf.distribute.Strategy API defines how multiple machines communicate together to train a model

MirroredStrategy: For training on multiple GPUs on a single machine. 

MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy: Similar to MirroredStategy, but for training on multiple machines.

ParameterServerStrategy: For training on multiple machines. Instead of syncing the weights on each device

TPUStrategy: For training on Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chip.

- keras API. Estimators simplify training, evaluation, prediction, and serving.

pre-made Estimators are DNNClassifier, DNNRegressor, LinearClassifier, and LinearRegressor. 

- training a custom estimator 

estimator = tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator(model, model_dir='./estimator_dir')

BATCH_SIZE = 32
def train_input_fn():
    train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train))
    train_dataset = train_dataset.batch(BATCH_SIZE).repeat()
    return train_dataset

- tensorboard 

$ tensorboard --logdir ./logs_keras

callbacks = [tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard('./logs_keras')]
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=1, validation_data=(x_test, y_test), callbacks=callbacks)

    + generating aggregates 
    
accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.Accuracy()
ground_truth, predictions = [1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0] # in practice this would come from the model
accuracy.update_state(ground_truth, predictions)
tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy.result(), step=4)

- tensorflow addons 

extended is an end to end machine learning platform for tensorflow 

Data Validation: A library for exploring and validating machine learning data.

Transform: A library for preprocessing data. 

Model Analysis: A library for evaluating TensorFlow models.

Serving: A serving system for machine learning models. 

    + model lifetime 
    
data validation > data transform > training of your model > model analysis > model serving 

- tensorflow lite and tensorflow.js 

TensorFlow Lite is designed to run model predictions (inference) on mobile phones and embedded devices. 

TensorFlow.js (also referred to as tfjs) was developed to empower almost any web browser with deep learning. It does not require any installation from the user and can sometimes make use of the device's GPU acceleration

- CNNs can handle multidimensional data. For images, a CNN takes as input three-dimensional data (height × width × depth)

width, height, depth 

unlike fully connected networks, where neurons are connected to all elements from the previous layer, each neuron in CNNs only has access to some elements in the neighboring region of the previous layer. 

This region (usually square and spanning all channels) is called the receptive field of the neurons (or the filter size):

zij = __delta__ *(b + sigam(l=0 to kH-1) signma(m = 0 to kW-1) sigma (n=0 to D-1) w_l,m,n * x_i+1,j+m,n)

matrix, 𝑧, of dimensions Ho × Wo, with Ho and Wo being the number of times the neuron can slide vertically and horizontall

- properties 

A convolutional layer with N sets of different neurons is thus defined by N weight matrices (also called filters or kernels) of shape D × k × k (when the filters are square), and N bias values. Therefore, this layer only has N × (Dk2 + 1) values to train.

When applying a CNN to images of various sizes, you still need to be careful when sampling the input batches. Indeed, a subset of images can be stacked together into a normal batch tensor only if they all have the same dimensions

- hyperparameters 

A convolutional layer is first defined by its number of filters, N, by its input depth, D (that is, the number of input channels), and by its filter/kernel size, (kH, kW). As square filters are commonly used

everal additional hyperparameters, affecting the way the filters are sliding over the images.

The larger the stride, the sparser the resulting feature maps.

- Available in the low-level API, tf.nn.conv2d() (refer to the documentation at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv2d) is the default choice for image convolution

main parameters are as follows:

input: The batch of input images, of shape (B, H, W, D), with B being the batch size.

filter: The N filters stacked into a tensor of shape (kH, kW, D, N).

strides: A list of four integers representing the stride for each dimension of the batched input. Typically, you would use [1, sH, sW, 1] 

padding: Either a list of 4 × 2 integers representing the padding before and after each dimension of the batched input, or a string defining which predefined padding case to use; that is, either VALID or SAME

name: The name to identify this operation

    + examples 
    
        * well known kernel for gaussian blur 

kernel = [[1/16 2/16 1/16],
          [2/16 4/16 2/16],
          [1/16 2/16 1/16]]

res = tf.nn.conv2d(batched_im, kernel, strides=[1,1,1,1], padding="SAME")

        * well known kernel for edge detection 
        
kernel = [[-1 -1 -1],
          [-1 8  -1],
          [-1 -1 -1]]
res = tf.nn.conv2d(batched_im, kernel, strides=[1,2,2,1], padding="SAME")

VALID means the images won't be padded (p = 0), and the filters will slide only over the default valid positions

opting for SAME, TensorFlow will calculate the value, p, so that the convolution outputs have the same height and width as the inputs for a stride of 1 (that is, solving Ho = Ho and Wo = W given the equations presented in the previous section, temporarily setting s to 1)

complex than zeros. In those cases, it is recommended to use the tf.pad() method (refer to the documentation at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/pad)

    + more network types 
    
 offers several other low-level convolution methods, such as tf.nn.conv1d() (refer to the documentation at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv1d) 

 tf.nn.conv3d() (refer to the documentation at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv3d), for one-dimensional and three-dimensional data, respectively

 tf.nn.depthwise_conv2d() (refer to the documentation at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/depthwise_conv2d) to convolve each channel of the images with different filters

```
# Initializing the trainable variables (for instance, the filters with values from a Glorot distribution, and the bias with zeros):
kernels_shape = [k, k, D, N]
glorot_uni_initializer = tf.initializers.GlorotUniform()
# ^ this object is defined to generate values following the Glorot distribution (note that other famous parameter more or less random initializers exist, also covered by TensorFlow)
kernels = tf.Variable(glorot_uni_initializer(kernels_shape), 
                      trainable=True, name="filters")
bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(shape=[N]), trainable=True, name="bias")

# Defining our convolutional layer as a compiled function:
@tf.function
def conv_layer(x, kernels, bias, s):
    z = tf.nn.conv2d(x, kernels, strides=[1,s,s,1], padding='VALID')
    # Finally, applying the bias and activation function (for instance, ReLU):
    return tf.nn.relu(z + bias)
```

- pooling layers 

with convolutional layers, you can pad the tensors before applying the operation (as shown in Figure 3.5):

Max-pooling layers return only the maximum value

average-pooling layers compute the average at each depth of the pooled area

- tensorflow/keras methods 

full connected layers 

fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=output_size, activation='relu')

- effective receptive field (ERF) of a neural network is an important notion in deep learning, as it may affect the ability of the network to cross-reference and combine distant elements in the input images.

- definitions 

ERF, the region of the input image 

term receptive field, RF used in place of ERF 

Ri = R_i-1 + (ki - 1) * PI(j=1 to i-1) si

ki is the filter size of the layer 

- impelment LeNet-5

The complete architecture is represented in the following diagram

a convolutional layer kernel size k = 5 and stride s = 1 follow by a max-pooling layer with k = 2 and s = 2

input images are zero padded by 2 


32x32> conv#1 (N=6, k=5, s=1, p=2) > 32x32> max-pool#1(k=2,s=2,p=0) > 14x14> conv#2 (N=16, k=5, s=1, p=0)  > 10x10 > max-pool#2(k=2, s=2, p=0)> 5x5(N=16)> FC#1(in=400, out=120) > 120x1 > FC#2 (in=120, out=84) > 84x1 > FC#3(in=84, out=10) > 10x1
    
    + tensorflow implementation 
```
from tensorflow.keras.model import Model, Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential() # `Sequential` inherits from tf.keras.Model
# 1st block:
model.add(Conv2D(6, kernel_size=(5, 5), padding='same', activation='relu', 
 input_shape=(img_height, img_width, img_channels))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
# 2nd block:
model.add(Conv2D(16, kernel_size=(5, 5), activation='relu')
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
# Dense layers:
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(120, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(84, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
```

    + TensorFlow Basics and Training a Model, Keras also provides the functional API. This API makes it possible to define models in a more object-oriented approach
    
    this can help to build one specific layer is reused several times inside the networks, or when layers have multiple inputs or outputs.

```
from tensorflow.keras import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

class LeNet5(Model): # `Model` has the same API as `Layer` + extends it
    def __init__(self, num_classes): # Create the model and its layers
        super(LeNet5, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = Conv2D(6, kernel_size=(5, 5), padding='same', 
                            activation='relu')
        self.conv2 = Conv2D(16, kernel_size=(5, 5), activation='relu')
        self.max_pool = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))
        self.flatten = Flatten()
        self.dense1 = Dense(120, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = Dense(84, activation='relu')
        self.dense3 = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    def call(self, x): # Apply the layers in order to process the inputs
        x = self.max_pool(self.conv1(x)) # 1st block
        x = self.max_pool(self.conv2(x)) # 2nd block
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.dense3(self.dense2(self.dense1(x))) # dense layers
        return x
```

- application to MNIST 

instantiate the optimizer (a simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer) and define the loss (the categorical cross-entropy) before launching the training

```
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
# We also instantiate some Keras callbacks, that is, utility functions automatically called at some points during training to monitor it:
callbacks = [
    # To interrupt the training if `val_loss` stops improving for over 3 epochs:
    tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=3, monitor='val_loss'),
    # To log the graph/metrics into TensorBoard (saving files in `./logs`):
    tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs', histogram_freq=1)]
# Finally, we launch the training:
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=80, 
          validation_data=(x_test, y_test), callbacks=callbacks)
```

- gradient descent challenges 

gradient descent process could be summarized in a single equation

P_i+1 <- P_i - v_i with v_i = __eta__ * dL_ii/dP_i

__eta__ is the learning rate 

    + momentum algorithms 

In tf.optimizers (also accessible as tf.keras.optimizers), momentum is defined as an optional parameter of SGD

```
optimizer = tf.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, # `momentum` = "mu"
                              decay=0.0, nesterov=False)
```

    + training step implementation manually 
    
```
@tf.function
def train_step(batch_images, batch_gts): # typical training step
    with tf.GradientTape() as grad_tape: # Tell TF to tape the gradients
        batch_preds = model(batch_images, training=True) # forward
        loss = tf.losses.MSE(batch_gts, batch_preds)     # compute loss
    # Get the loss gradients w.r.t trainable parameters and back-propagate:
    grads = grad_tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

- the ada family 

- early stopping 

Cross-validation is the key here to evaluate when training should be stopped. 

- The L1 and L2 regularizers are prime examples of this.

- In machine learning, a regularization term, R(P), computed over the parameters, P, of the method, f, to optimize 

L(y, y^true) + __lambda__ * R(P) with y = f(x, P)

R_L1(P) = ||P||1 = sigma(k)|P_k|

R_L2(P) = 1/2 * ||P||_2^2 = 1/2 * sigma(k) P_k ^ 2 

L2 regularization (also called ridge regularization) thus compels the network to minimize the sum of its squared parameter values. 

On the other hand, the L1 regularizer (also called the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regularizer, first introduced in Linear Inversion of Band-Limited Reflection Seismogram

L1 regularization instead makes the network shrink the parameters linked to less important features toward zero. it prevents overfitting by forcing the network to ignore less meaningful features (for instance, tied to dataset noise). In other words, L1 regularization forces the network to adopt sparse parameters. Good for minimized network size 

- tensorflow and keras implementations 

Additional losses can be attached to tf.keras.layers.Layer and tf.keras.Model instances through their .add_loss(losses, ...) method, with the losses tensors or zero-argument callables returning the loss values. 

simple convolution layer implemented previously to add optional regularization to its parameters
```
from functools import partial

def l2_reg(coef=1e-2): # reimplementation of tf.keras.regularizers.l2()
    return lambda x: tf.reduce_sum(x ** 2) * coef

class ConvWithRegularizers(SimpleConvolutionLayer):
    def __init__(self, num_kernels=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=1,
                 kernel_regularizer=l2_reg(), bias_regularizer=None):
        super().__init__(num_kernels, kernel_size, stride)  
        self.kernel_regularizer = kernel_regularizer
        self.bias_regularizer = bias_regularizer

    def build(self, input_shape):
        super().build(input_shape)
        # Attaching the regularization losses to the variables.
        if self.kernel_regularizer is not None:
            # for instance, we tell TF to compute and save
            # `tf.nn.l1_loss(self.kernels)` at each call (that is iteration):
            self.add_loss(partial(self.kernel_regularizer, self.kernels))
        if self.bias_regularizer is not None:
            self.add_loss(partial(self.bias_regularizer, self.bias))
```

 main loss is averaged (for example, MSE and MAE). 

    + the regularization losses can be computed listed and added to the main loss 
    
```
# We create a NN containing layers with regularization/additional losses:
model = Sequential()
model.add(ConvWithRegularizers(6, (5, 5), kernel_regularizer=l2_reg())
model.add(...) # adding more layers
model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))

# We train it (c.f. function `training_step()` defined before):
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for (batch_images, batch_gts) in dataset:
        with tf.GradientTape() as grad_tape:
            loss = tf.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(
                batch_gts, model(batch_images)) # main loss
            loss += sum(model.losses)           # list of addit. losses
        # Get the gradients of combined losses and back-propagate:
        grads = grad_tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

.add_loss(), as this method can greatly simplify the process of adding layer-specific losses to custom networks. 
    
    + we don't need to add regularization with Keras 
Keras even explicitly defines some regularizer callables in its tf.keras.regularizers module. Finally, when using Keras training operations (such as model.fit(...)), Keras automatically takes into account additional model.losses
```
# We instantiate a regularizer (L1 for example):
l1_reg = tf.keras.regularizers.l1(0.01)
# We can then pass it as a parameter to the target model's layers:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(6, kernel_size=(5, 5), padding='same', activation='relu', 
                 input_shape=input_shape, kernel_regularizer=l1_reg))
model.add(...) # adding more layers
model.fit(...) # training automatically taking into account the reg. terms
```

- dropout, through tf.nn.dropout(x, rate, ...) 

model = Sequential([ # ...
    Dense(120, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2),    # ...
])

- batch normalization 

Like dropout, batch normalization, is an operation that can be inserted into neural networks and affects their training. This operation takes the batched results of the preceding layers and normalizes them

Since batches are randomly sampled in SGD (and thus are rarely the same twice), this means that the data will almost never be normalized the same way.

- two widely used algorithms—YOLO and Faster R-CNN. Finally, building upon the two previous chapters

- understanding advanced CNN architecture 

The ImageNet classification contest (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC);

VGG (or VGGNet), developed by the Visual Geometry Group from Oxford University. 

- AlexNet is a game changer, first CNN successfully tained for such a complex recognition tasks and making several contributions that are still valid nowadays 

    + use rectified linear unit, (ReLU) as an activation function 
    
    + the application of dropout to CNNs 
    
    + the typical CNN architecture combining blocks of convolution and pooling layers, with dense layers afterward for the final prediction 
    
    + The application of random transformations (image translation, horizontal flipping, and more) to synthetically augment the dataset

- architecture 

They actually introduced six different CNN architectures, from 11 to 25 layers deep

typical VGG network 

input > CONV (N=64, k=3) > CONV (N=64,k=3) > max-pool (k=2, s=2) > 
       CONV (N=128, k=3) > CONV (N=128, k=3) > max-pool(k=2, s=2) > 
       CONV(N=256, k=3) > CONV(N=256, k=3) > CONV(N=256, k=3) > max-pool (k=2, s=2) > 
       CONV (N=512, k=3) > CONV (N=512, k=3) > CONV (N=512, k=3) > max-pool (k=2, s=2) > 
       CONV (N=512, k=3) > CONV (N=512, k=3) > CONV (N=512, k=3) > max-pool (k=2, s=2) > 
       dense (out = 4096, ReLU) > dropout (p=0.5) > dense (output=4096) > dropout (p=0.5) > dense (out=10000, softmax)

VGG-16 and VGG-19. The numbers (16 and 19) represent the depth of these CNN architectures; that is, the number of trainable layers stacked together. 

- replace large convolutions with multiple smaller ones 

a stack of two convolutions with 3 × 3 kernels has the same receptive field as a convolution with 5 × 5 kernels

while AlexNet has large filters (up to 11 × 11), the VGG network contains more numerous but smaller convolutions for a larger ERF. The benefits

    + It decreases the number of parameters: Indeed, the N filters of an 11 × 11 convolution layer imply 11 × 11 × D × N = 121DN values to train just for their kernels (for an input of depth D), while five 3 × 3 convolutions have a total of 1 × (3 × 3 × D × N) + 4 × (3 × 3 × N × N) = 9DN + 36N2 weights for their kernels.
    
    + It increases the non-linearity: Having a larger number of convolution layers—each followed by a non-linear activation function such as ReLU—increases the networks' capacity to learn complex features
    
- increasing the depth of the feature maps 

a max-pooling layer with a 2 × 2 window size and a stride of 2, the depth doubles while the spatial dimensions are halved.
    
- augmenting data with scale jittering 

scale jittering. At each training iteration, they randomly scale the batched images (from 256 pixels to 512 pixels for their smaller side)  properly classify them despite this scale jittering

- replacing fully connected layers with convolutions 

1 × 1 convolutions are commonly used to change the depth of the input volume without affecting its spatial structure. 

full connection network, FCNs can be applied to images of different sizes, with no need for cropping beforehand.

- implementations in tensorflow and keras 

implemented VGG-16 and VGG-19 networks are available in the tensorflow/models GitHub repository (https://github.com/tensorflow/models).

TensorFlow contributors, contains numerous well-curated state-of-the-art or experimental models

 have a look at the VGG code there (currently available at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim/python/slim/nets/vgg.py

- the keras model

Keras API has an official implementation of these architectures, accessible via its tf.keras.applications package
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications
```
vgg_net = tf.keras.applications.VGG16(
    include_top=True, weights='imagenet', input_tensor=None, 
    input_shape=None, pooling=None, classes=1000)
```

In Keras terminology, the top layers correspond to the final consecutive dense layers. Therefore, if we set include_top=False, the VGG dense layers will be excluded, and the network's outputs will be the feature maps of the last convolution/max-pooling block.

- GoogLeNet and the inception module 

task ahead of VGGNet. GoogLeNet (for Google and LeNet, as an homage to this pioneering network) is structurally very different

- architecture 

[google net architecture png](.\google-net-architecture.png)

- contribution - popularizing larger blocks and bottlenecks 

capturing various details with inception modules,  Network in Network (NIN) paper in 2013, the idea of having a CNN composed of sub-network modules

size 1x1, 3x3, 5x5 respectively, one max-pooling layer with stride 1 

- using 1x1 convolution as bottlenecks,  an input of shape H × W × D and return an interpolated H × W × N tensor. 

GoogLeNet has its parallel layers to compensate for the depth reduction. 

- pooling instead of fully connecting 

- fighting vanishing gradient with intermediary losses 

deeper CNNs are often plagued with vanishing gradient. Many CNN operations
