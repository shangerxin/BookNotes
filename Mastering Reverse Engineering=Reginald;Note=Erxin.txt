# Identification and extraction of hidden components 
- discuss 
    1. malware delivery 
    2. malware persistence 
    3. malware playload 
- Persistence is when malware consistently runs in the background

- SysInternals suite (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite)

- Microsoft introduced the registry system, which is actually stored in protected files called registry hives.

- filesystems, different disk filesystems such as FAT, NTFS, ex2, ex3, XFS, and APFS

- MacOS X versions, file information and data are stored in resource forks. Resource forks are actually deprecated but backward compatibility still exists on recent versions of MacOS. A file has two forks stored in the filesystem, the data fork and the resource fork.

simple copy mac application to window and then copy back will not work

- memory 
- registry system will store data like:
    + associated programs that execute expecific files 
    + aossiciate icons 
    + software settings 
    + user and group profiles 
    + printer setup 
    + designated drivers for specific services 
    
- typical malware behavior

    LAN (Local Area Network) or WAN (Wide Area Network), file sharing protocols are also open for attackers to abuse. 
    + media storage 

    it generates an autorun.inf file that points to the dropped executable file, as can be seen in the following example
    
    + exploits and compromised websites 
    
    download malware that can give the attacker more access. This concept was used to develop exploit kits
    
    User -[access sites with malicious] -> compromised sites can be a series of redirected landing pages -[exploit kit gate scans for vulnerabilities of the Users] -> User

    + flags, Every bit of the FLAGS register has its own purpose
    
0	CF	Carry flag. This flag is set when an addition operation requires a bit to be carried. It is also set when a bit needs to be borrowed in a subtraction operation.
1		Reserved
2	PF	Parity flag. This flag indicates if the number of set bits is odd or even from the last instruction operation.
3		Reserved
4	AF	Adjust flag. This is used in Binary-Coded Decimals (BCD). This flag is set when a carry happens from the low to high nibble or when a borrow happens from the high to low nibble of a byte.
6	ZF	Zero flag. This flag is set when the result of the last instruction operation is zero.
7	SF	Sign flag. This flag is set when the result of the last instruction operation is a negative number.
8	TF	Trap flag. This is used when debugging. This flag is set when breakpoints are encountered. Setting the trap flag can cause an exception on every instruction, enabling debugging tools to control step-by-step debugging.
9	IF	Interrupt flag. If this flag is set, the processor responds to interrupts. Interrupts are instances where errors, external events, or exceptions are triggered from hardware or software. 
10	DF	Direction flag. When set, data is read from memory backwards.
11	OF	Overflow flag. It is set if an arithmetic operation results in a value larger than what the register can contain.
12 to 13	IOPL	Input/output privilege level. The IOPL shows the ability of the program to access IO ports.
14	NT	Nested task flag. This controls the chaining of interrupt tasks or processes. If set, then it is linked to the chain.
15		Reserved
16	RF	Resume flag. It temporarily disables debug exceptions so the next instruction being debugged can be interrupted without a debug exception.
17	VM	Virtual mode. Sets the program to run in compatibility with 8086 processors.
18	AC	Alignment check. This flag is set when data written on a memory reference, such as the stack, is a non-word (for 4 byte boundaries) or non-doubleword (for 8 byte boundaries). However, this flag was more useful before the 486-architecture days.
19	VIF	Virtual interrupt flag. Similar to the interrupt flag, but works when in virtual mode.
20	VIP	Virtual interrupt pending flag. Indicates that triggered interrupts are waiting to be processed. Works in Virtual mode.
21	ID	Identification flag. Indicates if the CPUID instruction can be used. The CPUID can determine the type of processor and other processor info.
22		Reserved
23 to 31		Reserved
32 to 63		Reserved
    
    + The segment registers are used to identify the starting location of these sections, as follows:

- memory addressing
    + Endianness
    
        BYTE, WORD, DWORD, or even QWORD. Depending on the platform or program, data is read in little-endian or big-endian form.

    
        * In little-endian ahead to write into memory, a chunk of data read into a DWORD is reversed. Let's take the following piece of data as an example, read as DDCCBBAAh
        
        32 bit data:
        AA BB CC DD
        
        to memory little-endian:
        DDCCBBAA
        
        read sequence in little-endian:
        DDCCBBAAh 
        
        When read as BYTE, it will be AAh. When read as a WORD, it will be AAh. When read as a DWORD, it will be AAh.

        * in big endian, when read as a BYTE
        
        to memory big-endian:
        AA BB CC DD
        
        read sequence:
        AABBCCDDh
        
    + In x86 assembly, the little-endian format is the standard.    
        
- basic instructions, assembly language is made up of direct lines of code that follow syntax:

label/address mnemonic operands                 ;comments 
00A92DF9      move     eax, dword ptr[0AD4194]  ;moves the dword value at 0AD4194 to EAX 

A mnemonic is a human readable instruction, such as MOV, ADD and SUB.
        
- opcode bytes, operation code byte 

Address     Opcode          Instructions
00A92D7C    B8 00000080     MOV EAX,80000000h
00A92D81    B9 02000000     MOV ECX,2
00A92D86    F7E1            MUL ECX
        
MOV instruction is equivalent to the B8 opcode byte        

MOV EAX, 80000000h. It consists of the opcode byte, B8, and the operand value, 80000000h. The same number of bytes is also used in MOV ECX, 2, and MUL ECX uses 2 bytes        
        
The MOV instruction at the 00A92D81 address is equivalent to B9. The difference between the two MOV instructions is the register into which the DWORD value is moved. There are a total of 5 bytes consumed in MOV EAX, 80000000h.
        
- assembly language instructions can be categorized as follows 

Copying and accessing data instructions (for example, MOV, LEA, and MOVB)

Arithmetic instructions (for example, ADD, SUB, MUL, and DIV)

Binary logic instructions (for example, XOR, NOT, SHR, and ROL)

Flow control (for example, JMP, CALL, CMP, and INT)
        
- MOV is used to read the value at a given address, while LEA (Load Effective Address) is used to get the address instead

; using MUL and ADD to set address to eax 
mov ecx, 1111h
mov ebx, 2222h
mov eax, 2              ; eax = 2
mul ecx                 ; eax = 2222h
add eax, ebx            ; eax = 4444h
add eax, 1              ; eax = 4445h

; using LEA to set address to eax 
mov ecx, 1111h
mov ebx, 2222h
lea eax, [ecx*2+ebx+1]  ; eax = 4445h
        
- addition and subtraction 
        
mov ecx, 0x80000000
mov ebx, 0x80000000
add ecx, ebx
        
mov ecx, 0x7fffffff
mov edx, 0x80000000
sub ecx, edx
    
- increment and decrement 

inc eax 
dec eax 
        
- multiplication and division, Hence the product is stored in AX, DX:AX or EDX:EAX (long or QWORD)

mov eax, 0x80000000
mov ecx, 2
mul ecx
        
product stored in eax is zero (0), and edx now contains 0x00000001. SF =0; CF = 1; and OF = 1.
        
dividend is placed in AX, DX:AX, or EDX:EAX, and after the division operation, the quotient is placed in AL, AX, or EAX. The remainder is stored in AH, DX, or EDX.
        
- other signed operations 

NEG EAX or NEG dword ptr [00403000]. If EAX were 01h, it becomes FFFFFFFFh (-1).
        
MOVSX, moves a BYTE to WORD or WORD to DWORD, including the sign. It is a more flexible instruction than CBW, CWDE, CWD

CBW, Similar to MOVSX, it converts a BYTE into WORD, including the sign. The affected register is AL and AX. 

CWDE, converts a WORD into DWORD. It affects AX->EAX.

CWD, converts a WORD into DWORD. It affects AX-> DX:AX.

IMUL/IDIV, performs MUL and DIV, but accepts operands from other registers or memory.

- bitwise algebra

NOT AL 

AND, AL, AH  

OR AL, AH 

XOR AH, AL

SHL/SAL AL, 3 ; shifts bits to the left.

SHR/SAR AL, 3 ; shifts bits to the right.

ROL AL, 3 ; rotates bits to left 

ROR AL, 3 ; rotates bits to the right 

- control flow, The affected register in this is the index pointer IP/EIP, which holds the current address where the next instruction to execute is located.

JMP, direct jump to a given address 

jmp   eax
jmp   dword ptr [00403000]
jmp   dword ptr [eax+edx]
jmp   dowrd ptr [eax]
jmp   dword ptr [ebx*4+eax]

the CALL happens at the address 00401000, the top of the stack will contain the value 00401005h

RET instruction later to point EIP back to it

- conditional jumps

PUSH decreases the top-of-stack address by a DWORD size, for a 32-bit address space, then stores the value from its operand.

PUSH 1 If the top of the stack, stored in ESP, is at address 002FFFFCh, then the ESP becomes 002FFFF8h and stores 1 at the new ESP address.

POP retrieves the value from the top of the stack (ESP) then stores it to the register or memory space indicated in the operand. Then ESP is increased by a DWORD size. 

POP EAX If the address of the top of the stack, stored in ESP, is at address 002FFFF8h, and the stored DWORD value at the top of the stack is 0xDEADBEEF, then 0xDEADBEEF will be stored in EAX, while ESP becomes 002FFFFCh.

- PUSHA/PUSHAD both push all the general purpose registers to the stack in this order (for 32-bit builds): EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, EBP, ESP, EBP, ESI, and EDI. PUSHA is intended for 16-bit operands, while PUSHAD is for 32-bit operands.

- POPA/POPAD both pop all the general purpose registers from the stack and retrieved in a reverse order as stored by PUSHA/PUSHAD.

- PUSHF pushes the EFLAGS to stack.

- POPF pops the EFLAGS from stack

- ENTER is commonly used at the start of a subroutine. It is used to create a stack frame for the subroutine. Internally, ENTER 8,0 may roughly be equivalent to the following:

push ebp  ; save the current value of ebp 
move ebp, esp  ;stores current stask to ebp 
add esp, 8; create a stack frame with a size of 8 bytes 

- popular assemblers

    + MASM, MASM has been around for more than 30 years. It is maintained by Microsoft and is part of the Visual Studio product
    
    Compiling takes two steps: compiling the source into an object file, then linking all necessary modules required by the object file into a single executable

http://www.masm32.com/

    + NASM, netwide assembler, The official website for downloading NASM is at https://www.nasm.us/. For Windows, MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/) can be used to generate the executable. NASM is that sectioning of code and data is easily identified
    
    + FASM, FASM can be downloaded from http://flatassembler.net/, Flat Assembler, is similar MASM and NASM. Like MASM, it has its own source editor. Like NASM, the sections are easily identifiable and configured, and the software comes in flavors for both Windows and Linux:
