Automating and Orchestrating Networks with NetDevOps=Cisco;Note=Erxin

# Introduction
- NetDevOps is and how traditional network engineering can benefit from adopting DevOps software practices.



# Chapter 1
- SNMP is traditionally used as a pull-based mechanism that monitors tools to retrieve operational data regularly from the target devices.

- dev, code build, plan test; ops, deploy plan release monitor operate 

- HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) format and are human readable as well

- Ansible is an open-source automation tool commonly used for configuration management of the network

- Terraform is another open-source automation tool that is used for IaC capabilities in cloud and networking products. 



# Chapter 2, netDevOps 
- provisioning pipeline 

code -> security check -> deploy to dev -> testing -> deploy to prod -> testing -> cleanup 

- networking operations:

Provisioning

Configuration

Data collection

Compliance

Monitoring and alerting

Reporting

Migrations

Troubleshooting

Combined



# Chapter 3 how to implement ci/cd pipeline with jenkins 
- jenkins The syntax of the cron schedule in Jenkins is as follows:

MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW

DOW is the day of the week and is configured as a number in the range of 0–7. Both 0 and 7 are considered Sunday.

- Github hook trigger for gitscm pooling 

this list is available at https://api.github.com/meta.

On GitHub, enable a webhook on the git repository and add the Jenkins server as recipient for the webhook

On Jenkins, add the GitHub server with appropriate credentials (GitHub username and respective PAT).

Select Settings on that repository page. Next, under the General navigation pane, on the left side of this page, scroll down and click Webhooks.
 
the URL http://44.208.200.59:8080/github-webhook/ is configured and points to the Jenkins server’s public IP address. Other settings are left at the default value.

Add Credentials page, the following settings are used:

    Domain = Global credentials (unrestricted).

    Kind = Secret text.

    Scope = Global (Jenkins, nodes, items, all child items, etc.).

    Secret = enter personal access token (that is, copy and paste the PAT generated from GitHub.com).

    ID = netdevops-1.

    Description = netdevops-1.

    Click Add.

    Make sure to select this newly created account from the Credentials drop-down menu.
    
- Jenkinsfile in Git and Webhook
Let’s go through a use case where, instead of writing and keeping a scripted pipeline in the Jenkins UI, we create a “Jenkinsfile” that’s kept in the same GitHub repository along with the rest of the code.
