Performance testing with Jmeter3=Bayo Erinle

# Installation 
- scripts in jmeter 

jmeter.sh: This script launches JMeter GUI (the default)
jmeter-n.sh: This script launches JMeter in non-GUI mode (takes a JMX file as input)
jmeter-n-r.sh: This script launches JMeter in non-GUI mode remotely
jmeter-t.sh: This opens a JMX file in the GUI
jmeter-server.sh: This script starts JMeter in server mode (this will be kicked off on the master node when testing with multiple machines remotely; more on this in Chapter 6, Distributed Testing)
mirror-server.sh: This script runs the mirror server for JMeter
shutdown.sh: This script gracefully shuts down a running non-GUI instance
stoptest.sh: This script abruptly shuts down a running non-GUI instance

- commandline option 

$ jmeter.sh -? 

- classpath 

JMETER_HOME/lib: This is used for utility JARs.
JMETER_HOME/lib/ext: This is used for JMeter components and add-ons. All custom-developed JMeter components should be placed in the lib/ext folder, while third-party libraries (JAR files) should reside in the lib folder.

- configure proxy server 

./jmeter.sh -H proxy.server -P 7567 -u username -a password

- server mode 

JMeter will be kicked off in server mode on each remote server (slave), and then a GUI on the master server will be used to control the slave nodes. 

$ ./jmeter-server.sh

- overriding properties 

The options available to you include the following ones:
```
-D<property name>=<value>

Defining a local JMeter property:

-J<property name>=<value>

Defining a JMeter property to be sent to all remote servers:

-G<property name>=<value>

Defining a file containing JMeter properties to be sent to all remote servers:

-G<property file>

Overriding a logging setting, setting a category to a given priority level:

-L<category>=<priority>
./jmeter.sh -Duser.dir=/home/bobbyflare/jmeter_stuff 
-Jremote_hosts=127.0.0.1 -Ljmeter.engine=DEBUG
```

- configuring jmeter 

jmeter.properties file in the JMETER_HOME/bin folder

xml.parser: This specifies Custom XML parser implementation. The default value is org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser;

remote_hosts: This is a comma-delimited list of remote JMeter hosts

not_in_menu: This is a list of components you do not want to see in JMeter's menus. 

user.properties: This specifies the name of the file containing additional JMeter properties.

search_paths: This specifies a list of paths (separated by ;) that JMeter will search for JMeter add-on classes

user.classpath: In addition to JARs in the lib folder, use this attribute to provide additional paths that JMeter will search for utility classes

system.properties: This specifies the name of the file containing additional system properties for JMeter to use

ssl.provider: This specifies the custom SSL implementation if you don't want to use the built-in Java implementation;




# Record your first test
- start jmeter 

Right-click on Test Plan and navigate to Add | Threads (User) |
Thread Group.
Right-click on Thread Group and navigate to Add | Logic Controller | Recording Controller.

- browser extension 

Go to System Preference.
Click on Network.
Click on the Advanced... button.
Go to the Proxies tab.
Select the Web Proxy (HTTP) checkbox.
Under Web Proxy Server, enter localhost.
For port, enter 7000 (to match the port you set up for your JMeter
proxy earlier).
Do the same for Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS).

- setting up broser to use proxy 

configuring a proxy:

Click on Start and then click on Control Panel.
Click on Network and Internet.
Click on Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click on the Connections tab.
Click on the Local Area Network (LAN) Settings button.
To enable the use of a proxy server, select the checkbox for Use a proxy server for your LAN (These settings will not apply to dial-up or VPN connections), as shown in the following screenshot.
In the proxy Address box, enter localhost in the IP address.
In the Port number textbox, enter 7000 (to match the port you set up for your JMeter proxy earlier).
If you want to bypass the proxy server for local IP addresses, select the Bypass proxy server for local addresses checkbox.
Click on OK to complete the proxy configuration process:
