- certificate manager, certmgr.msc 

- BitLocker offers multiple key protectors that can be used to unlock a protected system:

TPM + startup PIN + startup key This is the most secure combination. The encryption key is stored on the TPM chip. The user might find this option cumbersome because it requires multiple authentication tasks.

- EFS uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which uses a 256-bit key algorithm

Trusted Platform Module (TPM),

- Data Recovery Agent (DRA), Encrypting File System (EFS) is a very secure method to protect sensitive data

- ip v6 address

- VPN protocols
Windows 10 supports four commonly used VPN protocols. 

Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) PPTP is the oldest and what is considered one of the least secure of all supported VPN protocols

Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) This protocol uses the IP security extensions (IPsec) for encryption and encapsulation. L2TP encapsulates the messages with IPsec, and then encrypts the contents using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) or Triple DES (3DES) algorithm.

Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) This is a recent protocol introduced with Windows Server 2008 and supported on Vista SP1 or later. It encapsulates PPP traffic using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which is widely supported on the internet and passes through TCP port 443

Internet Key Exchange, Version 2 (IKEv2) IKEv2 is most useful for mobile users and is the default protocol for Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 when trying to connect to remote access servers.

- Windows 10 to use the common authentication protocols:

EAP-MS-CHAPv2 This protocol uses Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), which offers the default and most flexible authentication option for Windows 10 clients.

PAP This is the least secure protocol since it uses plaintext passwords.

CHAP CHAP is used for down-level client compatibility and has been surpassed by MS-CHAP v2

MS-CHAP v2 This protocol is stronger than the CHAP protocol, with significantly improved security when partnered with EAP

- tools 
NSLookup, Use this tool to troubleshoot name resolution.

Tracert, Use this tool to determine the path that packets take to a designated target computer system, which helps you diagnose routing-related problems.

Pathping, This traces a network route similar to how the Tracert tool works but provides more statistics on the hops through the network.
